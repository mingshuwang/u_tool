<p>The Pesticides in Flooded Applications Model (PFAM) was developed to facilitate risk assessments for pesticides used in flooded-agriculture applications such as rice paddies and cranberries bogs. PFAM was designed around the specific parameters that are typically available for a pesticide risk assessment, thereby simplifying the assessment process by allowing the user to concentrate on providing only relevant model inputs. The model considers the fate properties of pesticides and allows for the specifications of common management practices that are associated with flooded agriculture such as scheduled water releases and refills. It also allows for natural water level fluctuations resulting from precipitation and evapotranspiration. </p>

<p>PFAM borrows heavily from the mathematical formulation of the processes used in the model EXAMS (Burns, 2000), which is a USEPA standard for modeling pesticide water quality for non-volume-varying bodies. Note that there are several models described in the literature that are aimed at determining water quality resulting from aquatic agriculture (e.g., Johnson, 1991; Jeon et al, 2007; Kim et al, 2008; Karpouzas and Etori, 2006; Tournebize et al., 2006; Yoshinaga, et al, 2004; Watanabe and Takagi, 2000), but none are specifically designed around the methods used for pesticide risk assessments, non-proprietary, and freely available for public inspections, as is desirable for USEPA regulatory models (NRC, 2007, USEPA 2009a).</p>

<p>PFAM is conceptualized in figure below and includes both hydrological processes and chemical processes. The water body depth may change due to precipitation, refill, drainage, evaporation, and weir-height changes. The model consists of two regions—a water column and a benthic region. Each individual region is completely mixed and at equilibrium with all phases within the individual region, and equilibrium within each region follows a linear isotherm. The two regions are coupled by a first-order mass-transfer process. Chemical transformation processes (i.e., hydrolysis, bacterial metabolism, photolysis, and sorption) within each region are formulations that were heavily borrowed from the USEPA EXAMS model (Burns, 2000). Changes in water body conditions (temperature, water levels, wind speed, etc) and the resulting changes in degradation rates occur on a daily time step. The selection of a daily time step was mainly because of the availability of a large amount of daily meteorological data (Burns et al., 2007) and the USEPA’s historical use of EXAMS on a daily time step.</p>
