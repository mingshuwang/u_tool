<p>EXAMS (Exposure Analysis Modeling System) evaluates the fate, transport, and exposure concentrations of synthetic chemicals including pesticides, industrial materials and leachates from disposal sites in surface water. EXAMS is based on a core of mechanistic (physically deterministic) processes developed from fundamental theoretical concepts (the mass conservation law). The quantity of the compound of interest entering and leaving the system is calculated as the sum of (1) external
loadings, (2) transport processes exporting the compound out of the system, and (3) transformation processes within the system that degrade the compound to its daughter products. The goal of EXAMS is to be able to predict for newly synthesized chemicals that have little direct data from the field the EECs (expected environmental concentrations) in a variety of ecosystems across a wide range of morphologic, geographic, and ecological conditions. EXAMS is capable of evaluating analysis of chronic chemical discharges using steady-state analysis, short-term chemical releases using initial value approaches, and simulations that allow for monthly variations in climatological parameters along with chemical loadings on a daily time-scale. EXAMS is often combined with PRZM to provide more refined estimates.</p>
