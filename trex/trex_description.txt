The purpose of this model is to calculate the residues on avian and mammalian food items along with the dissipation rate of a chemical applied to foliar surfaces (for single or multiple applications) in order to estimate acute and reproductive risk quotients. LD50 ft-2 values are calculated for both broadcast and banded (granular and liquid) applications using an adjusted LD50 method. The results are presented by weight class for various sized birds and mammals for each type of application. Avian and mammalian risk quotients are also calculated for seed treatment applications to various crop seeds.
